              Scrum is a framework that helps teams work together. It is
              designed for teams of 10 or fewer members, who break their work
              into goals, called sprints.

            <h4>Product Owner</h4>
            <p>
              The Product Owner is a kind of link between the customer and the
              development team.
            </p>
            <ul>
              The main responsibilities of the Product Owner:
              <li>Define and announce releases.</li>
              <li>Communicate delivery and product status.</li>
              <li>Share progress during governance meetings.</li>
            </ul>

            <h4>Scrum Master</h4>
            <p>
              The scrum master is not a traditional team lead or project
              manager, but acts as a barrier between the team and any
              distracting influences.
            </p>
            <ul>
              The main responsibilities of the Scrum Master:
              <li>
                Coaching the team, within the scrum principles, in order to
                deliver high-quality features for its product.
              </li>
              <li>
                Promoting self-organization and cross-functionality within the
                team.
              </li>

          <section>
            <h4>Development Team</h4>
            <p>
              Developers are the people in the Scrum Team that are committed to
              creating any aspect of a usable Increment each Sprint. The term
              developers refers to anyone who plays a role in the development
              and support of the system or product, and can include designers,
              data specialists, analysts, engineers, programmers....

            <h4>Sprint</h4>
            <p>
              A Sprint is the basic unit of development in Scrum. The sprint is
              a timeboxed effort, that is, the length is agreed and fixed in
              advance for each sprint and is normally between one week and one
              month, with two weeks being the most common.

            <h4>Sprint Planning</h4>
            <p>
              Sprint planning is an event in Scrum that kicks off the sprint.
              The purpose of sprint planning is to define what can be delivered
              in the sprint and how that work will be achieved. Sprint planning
              is done in collaboration with the whole scrum team.

            <h4>Daily Scrum</h4>
            <ul>
              Each day during a sprint, the developers hold a daily scrum with
              specific guidelines. All developers come prepared. The daily
              scrum:
              <li>should happen at the same time and place every day</li>
              <li>is limited to fifteen minutes</li>
              <li>is focused on inspecting progress towards the sprint goal</li>
              <li>may be facilitated by the scrum master</li>

          <section>
            <h4>Sprint Review</h4>
            <p>
              The purpose of the Sprint Review is to inspect the outcome of the
              Sprint and determine future adaptations. The Scrum Team presents
              the results of their work to key stakeholders and progress toward
              the product goal is discussed. During the event, the Scrum Team
              and stakeholders review what was accomplished in the Sprint and
              what has changed in their environment. Based on this information,
              attendees collaborate on what to do next.

            <h4>Sprint Retrospective</h4>
            <p>
              The purpose of the Sprint Retrospective is to plan ways to
              increase quality and effectiveness. The Scrum Team inspects how
              the last Sprint went with regards to individuals, interactions,
              processes, tools, and their Definition of Done. During the Sprint
              Retrospective, the team discusses:
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>What went well in the Sprint</li>
              <li>What could be improved</li>
              <li>What will we commit to improve in the next Sprint</li>

              Scrum artifacts play a vital role in building a picture of Scrum
              team progress. The three main Scrum Artifacts:

            <h4>Product Backlog</h4>
            <p>
              The product backlog is essentially a master list of all the
              changes that could be made to a product. These changes might be
              enhanced features, fixes, or technical work needed to keep the
              product functional and competitive.

          <section>
            <h4>Sprint Backlog</h4>
            <p>
              The sprint backlog is a list of tasks identified by the Scrum team
              to be completed during the Scrum sprint

          <section>
            <h4>Product Increment</h4>
            <p>
              The increment is the potentially releasable output of the sprint
              that meets the sprint goal. It is formed from all the completed
              sprint backlog items, integrated with the work of all previous
              sprints.

          <section>
            <p>
              Scrum is used in a variety of contexts to achieve many different
              aims. To accomplish those varying ends, Scrum is frequently
              tailored or adapted. A common approach to adapting Scrum is
              hybridization of scrum with other software development
              methodologies as scrum does not cover the whole product
              development lifecycle; therefore, organizations find the need to
              add in additional processes to create a more comprehensive
              implementation. The two main adaptations are Scrumban and Scrum of
              Scrums

            <h4>Scrumban</h4>
            <p>
              Scrumban is a project management framework that combines important
              features of two popular agile methodologies: Scrum and Kanban. The
              Scrumban framework merges the structure and predictable routines
              of Scrum with Kanban's flexibility to make teams more agile,
              efficient, and productive.

            <h4>Scrum of Scrums</h4>
            <p>
              Scrum of Scrums is a scaled agile technique that offers a way to
              connect multiple teams who need to work together to deliver
              complex solutions.

            <p>
              Kanban is a popular framework used to implement agile and DevOps
              software development. It requires real-time communication of
              capacity and full transparency of work. Work items are represented
              visually on a kanban board, allowing team members to see the state
              of every piece of work at any time.

          </section>
          <section>
            <p>
              A kanban board is an agile project management tool designed to
              help visualize work, limit work-in-progress, and maximize
              efficiency (or flow). It can help both agile and DevOps teams
              establish order in their daily work. Kanban boards use cards,
              columns, and continuous improvement to help technology and service
              teams commit to the right amount of work, and get it done!

          <section>
            <p>
              Kanban uses specific metrics to measure team capacity and estimate
              project length.

              <li>Team Velocity</li>

          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Team Velocity</h4>
            <p>
              Team velocity defines how many tasks a team can deliver in a given
              period of time, for example a week or iteration. Velocity is
              calculated periodically and to help with accuracy of the
              calculated velocity, teams aim to create tasks that are similar in
              size. Knowing team velocity helps better predict when a project is
              going to end.
            </p>
          </section>
          <section>
            <h4>Lead and Cycle time</h4>
            <p>
              Lead and Cycle time defines the average time it takes to complete
              a task. Lead time is calculated since the team gets a request from
              the client and cycle time is calculated since the team starts
              working on a task. Lead time is used to understand how long a
              client has to wait for their product and cycle time is used to
              understand how fast the team produces a product.
